Generate a detailed search query to find the API requirements for a specific endpoint based on the following natural language input: "I want to make an API call for [X] on [Y] platform"

The search query should:
1. Identify the platform ([Y]) and the specific API or feature ([X])
2. Include relevant keywords like "API documentation", "endpoint", "parameters", "authentication"
3. Specify the need for request format, response format, and any required headers
4. Ask for code examples in popular programming languages, if available
5. Request information on rate limits and usage restrictions

Format the output as a clear and concise search query that can be directly used in a search engine to find the most relevant API documentation and requirements.

Example input: "I want to make an API call for posting a tweet on Twitter"
Example output search query: 
"Twitter API documentation for posting tweets endpoint requirements authentication parameters request format response format code examples rate limits"
